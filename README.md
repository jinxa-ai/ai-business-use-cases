AI Use Cases for Business - Pragmatic, Governed and Measurable AI Use Cases
Purpose of This Repository

This repository presents a curated set of realistic AI use cases designed for business contexts.

Each use case is structured to:
	•	start from a concrete business problem
	•	assess AI relevance (and non-relevance)
	•	highlight constraints, risks, and costs
	•	avoid over-engineering and hype-driven implementations

How to Read These Use Cases

Each use case follows the same structure:
	1.	Business context
	2.	Problem statement
	3.	Why AI is (or isn’t) relevant
	4.	Proposed AI approach (high level)
	5.	Expected benefits
	6.	Risks & limitations
	7.	Cost & governance considerations

The goal is decision support, not technical demonstration.

Covered Domains
	•	Sales & Lead Management
	•	Customer Support & Service
	•	Operations & Process Automation
	•	Knowledge Management
	•	Decision Support

Important Disclaimer

Not all problems require AI.
Several use cases deliberately explain why a simpler rule-based or process approach may be preferable.

Next Steps

This repository may evolve with:
	•	anonymized client-like scenarios
	•	lightweight PoC illustrations
	•	cost control and monitoring patterns
	# Use Cases

This folder contains AI use cases documented with a business-first approach.

Each use case:
- starts from a real operational problem
- evaluates AI relevance pragmatically
- highlights risks, costs and governance considerations

## How This Repository Fits into the Overall Approach

This repository is the practical extension of a broader AI consulting framework.

Foundational principles, methodology and governance considerations are documented here:  https://github.com/jinxa-ai/AI-Consulting-Foundations

Each use case presented in this repository:
- follows the same decision framework
- applies the same risk and governance principles
- intentionally avoids technology-first reasoning
