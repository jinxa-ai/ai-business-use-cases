# Use Case — AI-Assisted Lead Qualification

## Business Context
Organizations receive a high volume of inbound leads through multiple channels, with heterogeneous quality and intent.

## Problem Statement
Sales teams spend significant time manually reviewing and qualifying leads, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

## Why AI?
Natural language analysis enables early detection of intent, urgency and fit based on unstructured inputs.

## Proposed AI Approach (High-Level)
- Lead text classification
- Scoring based on intent and context
- Human validation loop before action

## Expected Benefits
- Faster lead response
- Improved sales focus
- Better prioritization

## Risks & Limitations
- Bias in training data
- Over-filtering valuable leads
- Lack of explainability if not designed carefully

## Cost & Governance Considerations
- Monitoring of inference costs
- Clear thresholds for automation
- Human override mechanisms

## When AI Is Not the Right Solution
Low lead volume or already structured qualification forms.`
