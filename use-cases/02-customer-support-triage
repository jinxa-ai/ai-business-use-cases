#Use Case — Customer Support Triage & Routing

## Business Context
Customer support receives a high volume of inbound requests across email, chat, forms and social channels. Requests vary widely in urgency and complexity.

## Problem Statement
Manual triage is slow, inconsistent, and creates backlogs. High-value or urgent tickets may be missed, and teams waste time on repetitive categorization.

## Why AI?
AI can classify and route requests based on intent and context in unstructured text, improving speed and consistency without fully automating customer responses.

## Proposed AI Approach (High-Level)
- Ticket classification (topic, product, issue type)
- Priority detection (urgency, sentiment, SLA risk)
- Routing rules based on classification + business logic
- Suggested response drafts (optional) with human approval

## Expected Benefits
- Faster first response time
- More consistent routing and prioritization
- Reduced backlog and improved SLA compliance

## Risks & Limitations
- Misclassification leading to wrong routing
- Over-reliance on AI suggestions
- Hallucinations if AI is used to generate autonomous responses

## Cost & Governance Considerations
- Define “human-in-the-loop” as default for outbound messages
- Monitor misclassification rate and escalation patterns
- Implement confidence thresholds and fallback rules

## When AI Is Not the Right Solution
Low ticket volume, or when a strict form-based intake already captures structured fields reliably.

_This use case follows the principles defined in the AI-Consulting-Foundations repository._
