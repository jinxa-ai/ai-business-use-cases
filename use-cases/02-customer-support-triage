#Use Case — Customer Support Triage & Routing

## Business Context
Customer support receives a high volume of inbound requests across email, chat, forms and social channels. Requests vary widely in urgency and complexity.

## Problem Statement
Manual triage is slow, inconsistent, and creates backlogs. High-value or urgent tickets may be missed, and teams waste time on repetitive categorization.

## Why AI?
AI can classify and route requests based on intent and context in unstructured text, improving speed and consistency without fully automating customer responses.

## Proposed AI Approach (High-Level)
- Ticket classification (topic, product, issue type)
- Priority detection (urgency, sentiment, SLA risk)
- Routing rules based on classification + business logic
- Suggested response drafts (optional) with human approval

## Expected Benefits
- Faster first response time
- More consistent routing and prioritization
- Reduced backlog and improved SLA compliance

## Risks & Limitations
- Misclassification leading to wrong routing
- Over-reliance on AI suggestions
- Hallucinations if AI is used to generate autonomous responses

## Cost & Governance Considerations
- Define “human-in-the-loop” as default for outbound messages
- Monitor misclassification rate and escalation patterns
- Implement confidence thresholds and fallback rules

## When AI Is Not the Right Solution
Low ticket volume, or when a strict form-based intake already captures structured fields reliably.

##Success KPIs

The success of this use case should be measured using a limited set of operational and quality indicators:
	•	First Response Time (FRT)
Reduction compared to baseline manual triage.
	•	SLA Compliance Rate
Percentage of tickets handled within contractual response times.
	•	Routing Accuracy
Share of tickets correctly routed on first assignment.
	•	Backlog Volume
Evolution of open tickets over time.
	•	Manual Override Rate
Percentage of AI decisions overridden by human agents (early warning signal).

Important: KPIs must be reviewed weekly during the first rollout phase.

##Risk Assessment

| Risk                   | Description                                                 | Level |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Misclassification      | Incorrect routing leading to delays or customer frustration |   🟠  |
| Over-automation        | Excessive trust in AI decisions without human validation    |   🟠  |
| Hallucinated responses | AI generating incorrect replies if used autonomously        |   🔴  |
| Cost drift             | Uncontrolled inference usage during peak volumes            |   🟠  |

Mitigation principles:
	•	Human-in-the-loop as default
	•	Confidence thresholds before automation
	•	Clear escalation paths

##Data Prerequisites Checklist

Before implementing this use case, the following conditions should be validated:
	•	Historical support tickets available (minimum 3–6 months)
	•	Clear labeling of ticket categories and priorities
	•	Defined SLA rules and escalation logic
	•	Identified data owners (support, ops)
	•	Sensitive data handling rules documented
	•	Consent and compliance validated (PII, GDPR)

If more than two items are unchecked, AI implementation should be postponed.
