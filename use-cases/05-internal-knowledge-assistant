# Use Case — Internal Knowledge Assistant (Controlled RAG)

## Business Context
Internal knowledge is scattered across Notion, Google Drive, Slack, wikis, and onboarding documents. Teams repeatedly ask the same questions.

## Problem Statement
Information retrieval is inefficient. People depend on specific individuals to find answers, slowing execution and creating operational risk.

## Why AI?
A controlled assistant can retrieve relevant information from a curated knowledge base and provide answers with citations, improving autonomy and consistency.

## Proposed AI Approach (High-Level)
- Curate a knowledge corpus (scope control)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with source citations
- Content freshness rules (review cadence, ownership)
- Guardrails: refuse to answer outside scope; escalate to human

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced repetitive questions
- Faster onboarding and execution
- More consistent internal guidance

## Risks & Limitations
- Outdated content leading to wrong guidance
- Security exposure if access control is misconfigured
- “Confident but wrong” answers if citations are not enforced

## Cost & Governance Considerations
- Strong access control and role-based permissions
- Mandatory citations + “source of truth” links
- Regular knowledge maintenance process (owners, review schedule)

## When AI Is Not the Right Solution
If the organization lacks an authoritative knowledge base or ownership model; in that case, fix documentation governance first.
