# Use Case — Information Extraction from Emails & Documents

## Business Context
Teams receive contracts, emails, invoices, and operational documents containing key information needed for CRM, billing, or service delivery.

## Problem Statement
Critical data is trapped in unstructured content. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, and it slows down downstream processes.

## Why AI?
AI can extract structured fields from unstructured text (names, dates, amounts, requirements) and produce reliable summaries when properly constrained and validated.

## Proposed AI Approach (High-Level)
- Structured extraction into a fixed schema (JSON fields)
- Deterministic prompts with strict formatting requirements
- Validation layer (required fields, regex checks, cross-field consistency)
- Human review for low-confidence outputs or sensitive fields

## Expected Benefits
- Faster processing and reduced manual effort
- More consistent data capture
- Better downstream automation (CRM updates, invoicing, workflow triggers)

## Risks & Limitations
- Inconsistent outputs without strict schemas
- Errors on edge cases (complex formatting, ambiguous phrasing)
- Security risks if sensitive documents are processed without controls

## Cost & Governance Considerations
- Always define a fixed output schema + validation rules
- Keep a trace of source text snippets used for extraction
- Decide what data is allowed to be processed (PII boundaries)

## When AI Is Not the Right Solution
If documents are already standardized (e.g., structured forms) and simple rule-based parsing covers most cases.

_This use case follows the principles defined in the AI-Consulting-Foundations repository._
