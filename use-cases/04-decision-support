# Use Case — AI-Assisted Decision Support (Synthesis & Comparison)

## Business Context
Leadership and operations teams need to make decisions based on fragmented information: dashboards, qualitative feedback, tickets, sales notes, and reports.

## Problem Statement
Teams spend time collecting and synthesizing data rather than deciding. Insights are often biased by the most recent or loudest signals.

## Why AI?
AI can summarize, compare, and highlight patterns across multiple sources, accelerating preparation for decisions — without replacing decision ownership.

## Proposed AI Approach (High-Level)
- Summarization across selected sources (time-bounded)
- Comparison tables (pros/cons, trade-offs, scenarios)
- Highlighting anomalies, recurring themes, and risks
- Output designed as “decision memo” drafts, validated by humans

## Expected Benefits
- Faster decision preparation
- Better alignment through a shared synthesis
- Reduced cognitive load for stakeholders

## Risks & Limitations
- Hallucinated conclusions if sources are incomplete
- Misleading synthesis if data is biased or outdated
- False sense of certainty if outputs are not traceable

## Cost & Governance Considerations
- Require citations/links to underlying sources (traceability)
- Use defined time windows and source scopes
- Establish an approval step before distribution

## When AI Is Not the Right Solution
When decisions rely on highly precise numerical analysis that should be handled by analytics tooling and controlled calculations.

_This use case follows the principles defined in the AI-Consulting-Foundations repository._
